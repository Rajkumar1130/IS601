= How to Google Error Messages

[.column]
* A presentation about using Google, really?
* It's often the first stop on the debugging train, so why not talk about it?

== Verbosity

* Some languages don't shy away from giving you lots of information
* Java and Python are like this
* While it can be overwhelming, a great deal of time has been devoted to useful error messages:
** problem identification
** cause details
** possible solutions

== Traceback

* often the most overwhelming part of a Python error message
* a listing of all functions that were called to get to where the error occured
* sometimes called a backtrace or a stacktrace (because of how arguments are passed to functions)
* if you call too many functions you have a... https://stackoverflow.com/[Stack Overflow!]
* typically you care about the top or the bottom

# greetings.py
def who_to_greet(person):
    return person if person else input('Greet who? ')

def greet(someone, greeting='Hello'):
    print(greeting + ', ' + who_to_greet(someone))

def greet_many(people):
    for person in people:
        try:
            greet(person)
        except Exception:
            print('hi, ' + person)

[source,text]

$ python greetings.py
Hello, Chad
Hello, Dan
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "greetings.py", line 10, in greet_many
    greet(person)
  File "greetings.py", line 5, in greet
    print(greeting + ', ' + who_to_greet(someone))
TypeError: must be str, not int

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "greetings.py", line 14, in <module>
    greet_many(['Chad', 'Dan', 1])
  File "greetings.py", line 12, in greet_many
    print('hi, ' + person)
TypeError: must be str, not int

== Reproduce the Error

* Can you make it fail on command? This will help you nail down the error message.
* Can you create a minimal version of the code that causes the error? This will help you if you need to ask someone else.
* Sometimes just Googling the error message won't help you, you need context, "When I do X, Y happens."

== Docs Provide Context

* Even greater context comes from the docs
* Try just searching within the docs
* Include the package/framework you're using in your query: Django, FastAPI, Pandas, etc.

== Sometimes it's your job to keep digging
