= Universal Resource Identifiers

== URIs vs URLs

* Universal Resource Locators are a subset of URIs
* URLs are meant for resources on the Internet
* URIs can refer to any resource
* Some documentation will use them interchangeably

== URL Components

[.column]
image::url.webp[]

[.column]
* protocol (https://)
* subdomain (www)
* domain (website.com)
* path (/view/page-one)
* query params (?search=keyword)
* fragment identifier (#section1)

== URL encoding

* Not all characters are supported!
* URL encoding replaces unsupported characters with a `%` representation
* Spaces are replaced with `+`
* `Hello World!Â©` becomes `Hello+World%21%C2%A9`

== Uses

* We use URLs to request resources (Python requests)
* We establish endpoints (URLs) to respond to requests (Python FastAPI)
