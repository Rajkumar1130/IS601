== Purpose

* Store data reliably
* Retrieve relevant data easily
* Update data easily

== Relational Databases

* Most popular type of database
* Data is stored as rows in tables
* Tables have specific columns
* Each row will have the same columns
* Rules define what can go in a column

[.columns]
== Integrity

[.column]
* Relational DBs follow rules
* Ex: If you say a column can be used to lookup a row in another table, that _must_ be true
* Invalid operations aren't allowed
* Avoids invalid states

=== Foreign Key Constraint

* Let's assume our `item_list` table has a foreign key constraint that says `order_id` _must_ point to a valid `id` in the `orders` table
* What happens if we try to add a row to `item_list` with an `order_id` of `3`?
* What happens if we try to remove the row with `id=0` in the `orders` table?

=== Primary Key Constraint

* Each row must have a unique way of identifying themselves within a table
* For most of our tables this is covered by the `id` column.
* What can the _primary key_ be for the `item_list` table?

== Designing a Schema

* Try to avoid the _one big table_ school of design
* Think about the models that are interacting in your application
* Lean on the capabilities of the RDBMS, they're quick!
* Explicit is often better than clever (primary keys)
