= HTTP

Hypertext Transport Protocol

== Basics

* Application layer
* Client server design
* ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
* Request/Response
* Standardized status codes
* Adaptable
* Stateless

== Example

[plantuml,target=http.svg,format=svg]
....
Client -> Server: GET index.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: njit.edu
Server -> Client: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n...
....

[.columns]
== Parts of a Request

[.column]
. HTTP version type
. URL
. HTTP method
. request headers
. body (optional)

[.column]
image::http_request.png[]

[.columns.shrink]
=== HTTP methods

[.column]
* verb that indicates the action you want to take
* GET and POST are most common

[.column]
GET:: requests resource
POST:: creates a resource
HEAD:: GET _without_ the data
PUT:: replace resource
DELETE:: remove resource
PATCH:: partially modify a resource

=== Request headers

* Key value pairs on individual lines
* There are common request headers, but new ones can be created and old ones may stop being used
* In our first example we have a Host header, which tells the server the name of the host website you want. This allows one IP address to host multiple websites.

=== Request headers example

* Could be an image, HTML, JSON, or something else
* The Content-Type header will tell you how to interpret it
